# PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS-OF-AUSTRALIAN-RAINFALL-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

# Abstract
The research investigates the use of deep learning algorithms to predict rainfall in Australia. The study compares the performance of different models: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The LSTM model was found to be the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 85%.

# Background
Rainfall prediction is essential for various sectors:

1. Helps in planning agricultural activities.
2. Assists in managing water resources efficiently.
3. Aids in mitigating the effects of extreme weather events.
Traditional methods like statistical models and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have limitations, such as complex computations and sometimes inaccurate predictions. Machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have shown promise in improving prediction accuracy by modeling complex non-linear relationships.

# Objectives
The main goal is to develop a deep learning model that can provide accurate and timely rainfall predictions. This can enhance weather forecasting and disaster management strategies.

# Significance of Study
Deep learning models improve weather forecasting accuracy, which is crucial for:

Better planning and resource allocation.
Efficient management of water resources.
 Mitigating the impact of natural disasters like floods and droughts.
Identifying trends in historical rainfall data to adapt to climate change.

# Literature Review
  # Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Structure: Consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
Activation Functions: Uses nonlinear functions like sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent to introduce nonlinearity.
Training: Uses backpropagation to adjust weights and minimize errors.
Challenges: Slow convergence and local minima, but recent advancements have improved learning efficiency.
  # Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Capability: Suitable for modeling sequences due to their ability to pass information across time steps.
Expressive Power: Can simulate a universal Turing machine, making them powerful for sequence modeling.
Advantages over Markov Models: Can handle long-range dependencies and large state spaces more efficiently.
  # Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Architecture: Addresses the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs by using memory cells and gates to control information flow.
Applications: Effective for tasks requiring long-term dependencies, such as natural language processing and time series prediction.
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
Simpler Architecture: Similar to LSTM but with fewer parameters, making it easier to train.
Gates: Uses update and reset gates to retain or discard information, improving model performance.

# Data Description
The dataset from Kaggle includes:

23 Columns: Various meteorological parameters like rainfall, temperature, wind, and humidity.
145,460 Entries: Comprehensive data for predictive modeling.
Target Variable: “rainTomorrow” indicating whether it will rain the next day.
Data Preprocessing
Missing Data: Several features have missing values, with “Sunshine” having the highest percentage of missing data (48.01%).
List-wise Imputation: Excludes observations with missing values, reducing the dataset to 58,090 observations.

# Modeling
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Architecture: Layers with decreasing neuron counts (128, 64, 32) and ReLU activation function.
Performance: Suboptimal classification performance, indicating it may not be well-suited for this dataset.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Architecture: Three layers of SimpleRNN units with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Performance: Improved over MLP, but still not the best.
# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Architecture: Two LSTM layers with 64 units each, capturing long-term dependencies effectively.
Performance: Best among the models, with high specificity and sensitivity.
# Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
Architecture: Sequential neural network with GRU layers and dropout layers.
Performance: Good, but slightly lower than LSTM.
# Evaluation Metrics
Precision: Accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall (Sensitivity): Ability to capture all positive instances.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
Specificity: Ability to correctly identify negative cases.
ROC AUC Score: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
# Conclusion and Recommendation
LSTM Model: Recommended due to its high accuracy (85%) and specificity (95.46%).
MLP Model: Struggled with this dataset, achieving an accuracy of 83%.
GRU Model: Slightly lower performance than LSTM but still effective.
